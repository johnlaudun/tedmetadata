Some googling and stackoverflowing revealed that the `split` method is faster than any regex we could use. Fortunately, all we needed was to peel off the part after the last slant, so this use of `rsplit('/', 1)` (reverse split) goes one slant back from the end and creates a list with two items. We want the first item in that list, and the zeroth index, `[0]`, gives us that."
