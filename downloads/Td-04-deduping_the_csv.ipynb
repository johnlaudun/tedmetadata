The real question is, then, do we include these talks as part of our analysis or not?

Others, like speakers and descriptions, we want to make sure we are not throwing away any metadata which could be useful later. Both sets of columns are strings. In the case of the descriptions, it looks like those  from the Google document have had fancier punctuation -- e.g., smart quotes and em dashes -- replaced. This matters little, so differences here are trivial: but it would help to establish this by removing punctuation and comparing just the words.\n",
