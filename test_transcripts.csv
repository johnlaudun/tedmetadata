Why then do you need to pay expensive, for-profit journals for the results of that research? Erica Stone advocates for a new, open-access relationship between the public and scholars, making the case that academics should publish in more accessible media. ""A functioning democracy requires that the public be well-educated and well-informed,"" Stone says. ""Instead of research happening behind paywalls and bureaucracy, wouldn't it be better if it was unfolding right in front of us?""","  Do you ever find yourself referencing a study in conversation that you didn't actually read?    (Laughter)    I was having coffee with a friend of mine the other day, and I said, ""You know, I read a new study that says coffee reduces the risk of depression in women."" But really, what I read was a tweet.    (Laughter)    That said —    (Laughter)    ""A new study says drinking coffee may decrease depression risk in women.""    (Laughter)    And that tweet had a link to the ""New York Times"" blog, where a guest blogger translated the study findings from a ""Live Science"" article, which got its original information from the Harvard School of Public Health news site, which cited the actual study abstract, which summarized the actual study published in an academic journal.    (Laughter)    It's like the six degrees of separation, but with research.    (Laughter)    So, when I said I read a study, what I actually read was 59 characters that summarized 10 years of research.    (Laughter)    So, when I said I read a study, I was reading fractions of the study that were put together by four different writers that were not the author, before it got to me. That doesn't seem right. But accessing original research is difficult, because academics aren't regularly engaging with popular media. And you might be asking yourself, why aren't academics engaging with popular media? It seems like they'd be a more legitimate source of information than the media pundits. Right?    (Laughter)    In a country with over 4,100 colleges and universities, it feels like this should be the norm. But it's not. So, how did we get here?    To understand why scholars aren't engaging with popular media, you first have to understand how universities work. Now, in the last six years, I've taught at seven different colleges and universities in four different states. I'm a bit of an adjunct extraordinaire.    (Laughter)    And at the same time, I'm pursuing my PhD. In all of these different institutions, the research and publication process works the same way. First, scholars produce research in their fields. To fund their research, they apply for public and private grants and after the research is finished, they write a paper about their findings. Then they submit that paper to relevant academic journals. Then it goes through a process called peer review, which essentially means that other experts are checking it for accuracy and credibility. And then, once it's published, for-profit companies resell that information back to universities and public libraries through journal and database subscriptions. So, that's the system. Research, write, peer-review, publish, repeat. My friends and I call it feeding the monster.    And you can see how this might create some problems. The first problem is that most academic research is publicly funded but privately distributed. Every year, the federal government spends 60 billion dollars on research. According to the National Science Foundation, 29 percent of that goes to public research universities. So, if you're quick at math, that's 17.4 billion dollars. Tax dollars. And just five corporations are responsible for distributing most publicly funded research. In 2014, just one of those companies made 1.5 billion dollars in profit. It's a big business. And I bet you can see the irony here.    If the public is funding academics' research, but then we have to pay again to access the results, it's like we're paying for it twice. And the other major problem is that most academics don't have a whole lot of incentive to publish outside of these prestigious subscription-based journals. Universities build their tenure and promotion systems around the number of times scholars publish. So, books and journal articles are kind of like a form of currency for scholars. Publishing articles helps you get tenure and more research grants down the road. But academics are not rewarded for publishing with popular media.    So, this is the status quo. The current academic ecosystem. But I don't think it has to be this way. We can make some simple changes to flip the script.    So, first, let's start by discussing access. Universities can begin to challenge the status quo by rewarding scholars for publishing not just in these subscription-based journals but in open-access journals as well as on popular media. Now, the open-access movement is starting to make some progress in many disciplines, and fortunately, some other big players have started to notice. Google Scholar has made open-access research searchable and easier to find. Congress, last year, introduced a bill that suggests that academic research projects with over 100 million or more in funding should develop an open-access policy. And this year, NASA opened up its entire research library to the public. So, you can see this idea is beginning to catch on. But access isn't just about being able to get your hands on a document or a study. It's also about making sure that that document or study is easily understood.    So, let's talk about translation. I don't envision this translation to look like the six degrees of separation that I illustrated earlier. Instead, what if scholars were able to take the research that they're doing and translate it on popular media and be able to engage with the public? If scholars did this, the degrees of separation between the public and research would shrink by a lot. So, you see, I'm not suggesting a dumbing-down of the research. I'm just suggesting that we give the public access to that research and that we shift the venue and focus on using plain language so that the public who's paying for the research can also consume it.    And there are some other benefits to this approach. By showing the public how their tax dollars are being used to fund research, they can begin to redefine universities' identities so that universities' identities are not just based on a football team or the degrees they grant but on the research that's being produced there. And when there's a healthy relationship between the public and scholars, it encourages public participation in research. Can you imagine what that might look like?    What if social scientists helped local police redesign their sensitivity trainings and then collaboratively wrote a manual to model future trainings? Or what if our education professors consulted with our local public schools to decide how we're going to intervene with our at-risk students and then wrote about it in a local newspaper? Because a functioning democracy requires that the public be well-educated and well-informed. Instead of research happening behind paywalls and bureaucracy, wouldn't it be better if it was unfolding right in front of us?    Now, as a PhD student, I realize I'm critiquing the club I want to join.    (Laughter)    Which is a dangerous thing to do, since I'm going to be on the academic job market in a couple of years. But if the status quo in academic research is to publish in the echo chambers of for-profit journals that never reach the public, you better believe my answer is going to be ""nope."" I believe in inclusive, democratic research that works in the community and talks with the public. I want to work in research and in an academic culture where the public is not only seen as a valuable audience, but a constituent, a participant. And in some cases even the expert. And this isn't just about giving you guys access to information. It's about shifting academic culture from publishing to practice and from talking to doing.    And you should know that this idea, this hope — it doesn't just belong to me. I'm standing on the shoulders of many scholars, teachers, librarians and community members who also advocate for including more people in the conversation. I hope you join our conversation, too.    Thank you.    (Applause)  "

Mycologist and TED Fellow Mennat El Ghalid explains how a breakthrough in our understanding of the molecular signals fungi use to attack plants could disrupt this interaction — and save our crops.","  ""Will the blight end the chestnut? The farmers rather guess not. It keeps smouldering at the roots And sending up new shoots Till another parasite Shall come to end the blight.""    At the beginning of the 20th century, the eastern American chestnut population, counting nearly four billion trees, was completely decimated by a fungal infection. Fungi are the most destructive pathogens of plants, including crops of major economic importance. Can you imagine that today, crop losses associated with fungal infection are estimated at billions of dollars per year, worldwide? That represents enough food calories to feed half a billion people. And this leads to severe repercussions, including episodes of famine in developing countries, large reduction of income for farmers and distributors, high prices for consumers and risk of exposure to mycotoxin, poison produced by fungi.    The problems that we face is that the current method used to prevent and treat those dreadful diseases, such as genetic control, exploiting natural sources of resistance, crop rotation or seed treatment, among others, are still limited or ephemeral. They have to be constantly renewed. Therefore, we urgently need to develop more efficient strategies and for this, research is required to identify biological mechanisms that can be targeted by novel antifungal treatments.    One feature of fungi is that they cannot move and only grow by extension to form a sophisticated network, the mycelium. In 1884, Anton de Bary, the father of plant pathology, was the first to presume that fungi are guided by signals sent out from the host plant, meaning a plant upon which it can lodge and subsist, so signals act as a lighthouse for fungi to locate, grow toward, reach and finally invade and colonize a plant. He knew that the identification of such signals would unlock a great knowledge that then serves to elaborate strategy to block the interaction between the fungus and the plant. However, the lack of an appropriate method at that moment prevented him from identifying this mechanism at the molecular level.    Using purification and mutational genomic approaches, as well as a technique allowing the measurement of directed hyphal growth, today I'm glad to tell you that after 130 years, my former team and I could finally identify such plant signals by studying the interaction between a pathogenic fungus called Fusarium oxysporum and one of its host plants, the tomato plant. As well, we could characterize the fungal receptor receiving those signals and part of the underlying reaction occurring within the fungus and leading to its direct growth toward the plant.    (Applause)    Thank you.    (Applause)    The understanding of such molecular processes offers a panel of potential molecules that can be used to create novel antifungal treatments. And those treatments would disrupt the interaction between the fungus and the plant either by blocking the plant signal or the fungal reception system which receives those signals. Fungal infections have devastated agriculture crops. Moreover, we are now in an era where the demand of crop production is increasing significantly. And this is due to population growth, economic development, climate change and demand for bio fuels. Our understanding of the molecular mechanism of interaction between a fungus and its host plant, such as the tomato plant, potentially represents a major step towards developing more efficient strategy to combat plant fungal diseases and therefore solving of problems that affect people's lives, food security and economic growth.    Thank you.    (Applause)  "
https://www.ted.com/talks/ndidi_nwuneli_the_role_of_faith_and_belief_in_modern_africa,Ndidi Nwuneli,PT13M12S,2018-03-29T14:53:59+00:00,662380,"Ndidi Nwuneli has advice for Africans who believe in God — and Africans who don't. To the religious, she advises against using God to outsource responsibility for what happens in their lives. To the non-religious, she asks that they keep an open mind and work with faith-based organizations, especially on issues like health care and education. ""There's so much potential that can be realized when we walk across the divide of faith and, hand in hand, try to solve many of our problems,"" Nwuneli says.","  I was born to two amazing professors who were not religious. In fact, my father's regular response to the question about why we didn't go to church on Sundays was, ""When others go to pray, I go to play."" Tennis, in case you're wondering. Faith found me and my siblings when university students came to our house to invite us to Sunday school. I was drawn by their sense of personal conviction and their life of service, and opted for baptism into the Christian faith as my 10th birthday present.    My faith has shaped my work as a social entrepreneur, attempting to address Africa's most pressing challenges over the last 17 years, and my work training youth as leaders and promoting ethics across Africa. Twenty-nine years later, as a Sunday school teacher myself, my faith was challenged by a young nine-year-old who asked a series of questions. He asked, ""Ms. Ndidi, does God hate Africans?"" To which I quickly retorted, ""Of course not. God loves all his children equally."" Then he asked, ""So why do so many young African children die?"" I stumbled and mumbled as I responded. ""There are many reasons why young African children die. Most of them are man-made, and we cannot blame God."" So he asked, ""Why does he let it happen? He could stop it."" And I said ... ""Yes he could, yes he could, but he sent us here as change agents, light of the world, salt of the earth, and we are failing.""    Africa has had a mixed affair with organized religion, with both positive and negative consequences. The Christian missionaries educated most of our political elite, like Senghor and Nkrumah, built many of our first hospitals and schools. Similarly, Islam has introduced commerce and mathematics across the continent. Today, we have over a billion Africans who profess a strong faith. What is the net effect of this on our continent? A recent ""Economist"" article said that the face of the future of the world's most popular religion is African. Now, both Islam and Christianity underscore the importance of social impact as critical tenets of our faith. Muhammad is noted for stating that he is not a believer who goes to bed on a full stomach when his neighbor to his side is hungry. And all through the New Testament, Jesus Christ talks about loving your neighbors as yourselves, giving to the poor, caring for the sick, and James, too, says that ""faith without works is dead."" So I strongly believe that faith-based organizations have a critical role to play in driving social impact in Africa. But for this to occur, we need three critical changes.    The first is that we need to change our mindsets. Both as people of faith and of those who are not religious, their perceptions of those of us who are people of faith. Now, for people of faith and those of us who are religious, we often say, ""If God wills, I'll do this; inshallah, I'll do that — by God's grace, I'll do this."" Now there are many things, I believe, that we can control — some we cannot. I believe that God is all-powerful, but he's not a micromanager.    (Laughter)    He has sent us here as his change agents, and we must stop making excuses and using him. That means that if you're a teacher, go to school and give your students the best. If you're a public-sector official, release the funds meant for that school or public health-care center instead of stealing it for your personal purposes. By claiming that we have no power over our past, present and future, we give too much authority to the wicked who steal funds and beg God for forgiveness.    Now for those of you who are not religious, you also have to change your mindsets about us. There are many of us who are hardworking, ethical and intellectual. It might surprise you.    (Laughter)    Now the second step is that we have to utilize our resources and assets for social impact. In England, 1,900 churches have been shut down since 1969, due to shrinking congregations, while in Africa, every single day, a church or mosque is being built. In some communities, you might not find a public health center, a post office or even a school, but you'll find a church or mosque. Some of these churches and mosques are world-class, with excellent audio-visual systems, wonderful meeting spaces, and they organize events that rival international concerts. The sad reality is that many of them are empty during the week. I live in the Lekki area of Lagos, and in my community, there are at least 50 really nice churches, but there's no adult literacy center, no homeless shelter and very few public schools and hospitals. Many of these spaces could be utilized for social change. Imagine if every single church in Lekki opened its doors to the homeless at night, gave them a sleeping bag, a warm meal and a voucher in the morning to learn a vocational course, offered by the unemployed youth who attend that church. That would demonstrate what we preach and what we speak about as people of faith, and what led me to Christianity in the first place.    Similarly, we have to utilize our resources for social change. The 2016 ""why give"" survey conducted in Kenya reveals that close to 60 percent of adults give to faith-based organizations — even more than they give their extended families. This is not unique to Kenya. It's quite prevalent across Africa. Many of our faith-based organizations have tremendous amounts of wealth that can be utilized for social change. We have to check the sources of uses of these funds and curb the excesses by our faith-based organizations. Now, this will require courage on the part of members, who will have to put their imams and priests on straight salaries, require audited financial statements that will be published and even reject contributions from unethical sources. But it's possible. We're already seeing positive examples in South Africa and Kenya, and the organizations, such as the Africa Council for Accreditation and Accountability that's checking faith-based organizations and ensuring that they comply with biblical standards of stewardship.    Now, the third step is that we have to partner with all stakeholders, and this is especially relevant for the non-religious in the audience. Recognizing the power and potential of faith-based organizations, leveraging their assets, their scale, the public trust and credibility they have, their lower operating costs, their access to the grassroots and their presence abroad. Politicians recognize this, and campaign seasons are always filled with stops and picture opportunities with leading faith leaders. Sadly, once elected, many of these faith-based organizations are ignored. And in fact, a World Bank survey revealed that 30 to 70 percent of assets owned by medical organizations in Africa are actually owned by faith-based organizations, but that there's very little collaboration between the faith community and public health-care systems. One positive example is from Ghana, where the Ghana Catholic Health Service partnered with a range of stakeholders and was able to realize a 31 percent reduction in mortality.    I believe there's so much potential that can be realized when we walk across the divide of faith and, hand in hand, try to solve many of our problems.    Similarly, faith-based organizations can support the transfer of critical skills and knowledge. Many of you in the NGO community or in the private sectors realize how difficult it is to even attract 150 to 200 people to your conferences, sometimes even offering stipends, reimbursements of transportation costs. Meanwhile, faith-based organizations draw thousands and millions every Sunday or Friday ... with the promise of a good sermon.    The truth is we cannot address issues around family planning without faith-based organizations in Africa. Issues such as democratic rights and voter registration, ensuring that every member of a congregation has a voter registration card, understands their democratic rights and can exercise that. I really think it's critical that we consider partnering with faith-based organizations to deliver social impact.    It's also important to note that African faith-based organizations have a strong presence globally. There are over 2,000 African nuns and priests in leadership positions in Europe, with more influence than some of our diplomatic envoys, operating at a fraction of the cost. They can serve as influencers and supporters. Similarly, some African churches have a presence in countries across the globe, and the Redeemed Christian Church of God has a presence in 196 countries, serving as a bridge to the diaspora and providing support. If our public-sector organizations could partner with these institutions, we could unlock the potential of our diaspora populations.    I know some of you are still struggling with this topic, but I challenge you to think about it. A wise man once said, ""Faith is a risk, but it's a risk that I cannot afford not to take."" I would suggest that partnerships with faith-based organizations are a risk, but one that all stakeholders that are committed to social impact in Africa cannot afford not to take.    I often reflect on my conversation with that young boy, and I believe I should have ended it a little differently. First, I should have commended him for asking tough questions. Africa needs more young people who challenge the status quo, even in the faith communities. Secondly, I should have given him a little more hope. Not hope in the afterlife, but hope in Africa today, because the faithful are powerful. Not just because of their beliefs but because of their assets, their resources, their army of volunteers, and because working together, across the divide, we can live as positive examples for what our children — my children, your children — deserve to see. An Africa that demonstrates that God loves Africans and that we are just as capable as any other world region in solving our problems in peace ... and love.    I love this quote that says, ""Hope is the ability to hear the melody of the future. Faith is the willingness and the courage to dance to it today."" I hope that we, as people of faith, can truly live up to the promise of social impact that we have been called to do as change agents in society. And I believe that working with you, all stakeholders, we can truly solve Africa's most pressing challenges. I have that hope ... and I have the faith, and I've started to dance. Won't you join me?    Thank you.    (Applause)  "
